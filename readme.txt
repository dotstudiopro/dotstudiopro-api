paywalls, advertising and other features.

You will need to install the "Featured Video Plus" Wordpress plugin by Alexander HÃ¶reth.  This plugin allows you to 
insert your videos from the dotstudioPRO into specific pages.

may not be desirable all the time, and can be enabled and disable globally or disabled for specific videos.

= What is the best way to customize the video channel and category pages? =

Customization without modifying the original plugin can be achieved by copying the template files from the plugin folder
to your active theme folder.  This can be done by going to the dotstudioPRO Options and clicking the "COPY" button towards
the bottom of the Plugin Configuration tab.  Once you have copied these files into your active theme folder this way, you
can manipulate the styles and layouts any way you wish.  The files that are copied over are:

1. ds-all-categories.tpl.php
2. ds-home.tpl.php
3. ds-single-category.tpl.php
4. ds-single-channel-w-sidebar.tpl.php
5. ds-single-channel.tpl.php
6. video-channel.customization.css


= Where do I create video channels and categories? =
Video channels and categories are created through the dotstudioPRO dashboard.  Whenever you change any of your videos, 
channels or categories, you'll need to update the data on your website.  To re-sync and rebuild the categories and channels
on your site after you have modified them through the dashboard, click the "RE-SYNC" button in the dotstudioPRO Plugin 
Configuration area.
